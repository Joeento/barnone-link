# BarNone

I've been working on an OpenCV project as part of our 10% time at work and it's ballooned into something I'm very proud of.  BarNone is a web app that can take in photos of damaged or worn barcodes, fix them, and then export them to pdf for printing.  The intention is to give it to canneries or anyone else who makes a living recycling bottles so that they can increase the amount they recycle and pocket more money.

BarNone is made in python using OpenCV.  I'm also working on a UI made with flask on the backend and React on the frontend, but it's a work in progress.  You can see the code [here](https://github.com/rmm/ten_percent_practice/tree/master/eric_kudler/barnone).
